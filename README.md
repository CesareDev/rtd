# rtd

Command line tool, written in `rust`, for managing your todo list. I take this project as an opportunity to learn the `rust` programming language. This is not intended to be a perfect tool but only a recreational project.

## Requirements

- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/it)

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd rtd
cargo build -r
```

The executable will be located in the `target/release` directory. If you want you can build the debug version by running `cargo build` without the `-r` flag.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tool is not yet implemented.

## Mentions
